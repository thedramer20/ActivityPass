# ActivityPass

AI-assisted student activity management platform for Zhejiang Normal University (ZJNU).

## Overview
ActivityPass streamlines how college staff publish extracurricular activities and how students discover and join them. It applies rule-based eligibility checks (schedule conflicts, major/college match, participation limits, language level) and will progressively integrate AI models for smarter qualification scoring and personalization.

## Core Goals (Phase 1)
1. Unified backend (Django) providing REST API endpoints for activities, users, participation, and timetable ingestion.
2. React frontend for staff dashboards and student browsing/applications.
3. Parsing utility (legacy scripts in `reference/`) to extract timetable/course data from PDFs and generate iCalendar (.ics) feeds.
4. Basic rules:
   - Max 7 activities per student per academic year (2 guaranteed core + up to 5 additional elective slots).
   - No overlap with class schedule (time conflict check).
   - Respect major/college restrictions.
   - Optional Chinese language proficiency level gating.
   - Reduced prioritization if already holding required baseline (e.g., after 2 core activities).

## Planned AI Integration (Future Phases)
| Phase | Capability |
|-------|------------|
| 2 | NLP-based extraction from new timetable formats, improved PDF/HTML parsing. |
| 3 | Student fit scoring model (history, performance, interests). |
| 4 | Recommendation engine & load balancing for fair distribution. |
| 5 | Predictive attendance and dynamic capacity adjustment. |

## Tech Stack
| Layer | Technology |
|-------|-----------|
| Backend | Python 3, Django, Django REST Framework (planned) |
| Frontend | React (Create React App scaffold) |
| Data | PostgreSQL (planned), SQLite (dev), Redis (caching sessions - planned) |
| AI | Transformers / Open-source LLMs (future), rule engine (initial) |

## Getting Started
### Prerequisites
- Python 3.11+ (recommended)
- Node.js 18+ and npm
- (Future) PostgreSQL service for production

### Backend Setup
```pwsh
cd backend
python -m venv .venv
.\.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
pip install django djangorestframework
python manage.py migrate
python manage.py runserver
```
Server runs at http://127.0.0.1:8000/

### Frontend Setup
```pwsh
cd frontend
npm install
npm start
```
App runs at http://localhost:3000/

## Next Steps
- Define Django apps: users, activities, eligibility, timetable.
- Implement timetable upload endpoint; integrate parsing logic adapted from `reference/`.
- Introduce authentication (Django auth + JWT for SPA usage).
- Draft eligibility service (class conflict, count cap, major filter, language requirement).
- Add testing (pytest + React Testing Library) & CI workflow.

## Contributing
Contributions are welcome! Please open an issue describing the enhancement or bug. Ensure code follows PEP8 (backend) and ESLint (frontend) standards. Include tests for new logic.
